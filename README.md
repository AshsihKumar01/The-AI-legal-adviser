# Justice Genie ðŸŽ—

**Justice Genie** is an AI-powered legal advisor platform built using Streamlit, LangChain, and Google Generative AI. This tool allows users to upload legal documents (PDFs) and interact with the AI to get insights, analyze documents, and receive answers to legal queries based on a growing knowledge base. The platform is designed to provide reliable and context-aware legal advice in a user-friendly manner.

## Features
- **PDF Document Analysis**: Users can upload legal documents in PDF format, which the AI analyzes to provide insights and relevant information.
- **Knowledge Base**: As more documents are uploaded, Justice Genieâ€™s knowledge base expands, enabling the AI to provide increasingly accurate advice.
- **Question-Answering System**: Users can ask questions related to the uploaded legal documents, and the AI will generate precise answers based on the content.
